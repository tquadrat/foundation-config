<p>The module <code>org.tquadrat.foundation.config</code> provides an easy way
    to provide configuration settings &mdash; in the widest sense of that term
    &mdash; to a program. This comprises</p>
<ul>
    <li>Parsing and Interpretation of the Command Line</li>
    <li>Storage and Retrieval of Preferences</li>
    <li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>The core is the generation of a <i>configuration bean</i> through an
    annotation processor, based on the <i>configuration bean specification</i>,
    an annotated interface that itself extends the interface
    {@link org.tquadrat.foundation.config.ConfigBeanSpec}.</p>
<p>The details are explained in the description for the package
    {@link org.tquadrat.foundation.config}.</p>
<p>The command line parser can be used also with a configuration through an
    XML file, or with a programmatic configuration; this is described in the
    package
    {@link org.tquadrat.foundation.config.cli}.</p>
